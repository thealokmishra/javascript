    const div = document.createElement("div"); //creating a new div element using the createElement method of the document object. This method takes a string argument that specifies the type of element to create e.g."div", "p", "span", "h1",etc,  in this case, "div". The created div element is stored in the variable div for further manipulation.
    console.log(div);
    div.className = "main"; // assigning a class name to the div element using the className property. In this case, the class name "main" is assigned to the div element, which can be used for styling or selecting the element later.
    div.id = Math.round(Math.random() * 10 + 1); // assigning a random id to the div element using the id property. The id is generated by rounding a random number between 0 and 1, multiplying it by 10, and adding 1 to ensure that the id is between 1 and 10. This can be useful for uniquely identifying the element in the DOM.
    div.setAttribute("title", "generated title"); // setting a custom attribute "title" on the div element using the setAttribute method. This method takes two arguments: the name of the attribute to set (in this case, "title") and the value to assign to that attribute (in this case, "generated title"). This can be used to store additional information about the element or for styling purposes.
    div.style.backgroundColor = "green";
    div.style.padding = "12px";
    // div.innerText = "Alok Mishra"
    const addText = document.createTextNode("Hello World"); // creating a text node using the createTextNode method of the document object. This method takes a string argument that specifies the text content to create. In this case, the text "Hello World" is created and stored in the variable addText.
    div.appendChild(addText); // appending the created text node to the div element using the appendChild method. This method takes a node as an argument and adds it as a child of the specified element. In this case, the addText node (which contains the text "Hello World") is appended to the div element, making it a child of the div in the DOM.

    document.body.appendChild(div); // appending the div element (which now contains the text "Hello World") to the body of the document using the appendChild method. This adds the div element to the DOM, making it visible on the webpage.
